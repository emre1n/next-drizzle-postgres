# Next 14 App with Drizzle ORM & PostgreSQL DB

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## The Plan

1. Install `drizzle-orm`, `pg` ([node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/)) packages to dependencies and `drizzle-kit`, `@types/pg` to devDependencies.
2. Create `schema.ts` within `db` directory which is located at the root directory.
3. Create `migrate.ts` within `db` directory.
4. Create `index.ts` within `db` directory where the `Client` will be initiated.
